### JMeter AMF Plugin
-----------------------

Note: This project is currently in an alpha state. Source code will be added shortly. Click the Watch button for updates.

Welcome to the JMeter-AMF Plugin Project. This plugin gives JMeter the ability to load test applications 
using the AMF3 protocol. Main features:

* Record AMF and HTTP traffic with the AMF Proxy Server
* Translate AMF to XML for easy manipulation
* Set override parameters to provide each virtual user with unique Client and Session IDs

### Requirements
-----------------------

* JMeter 2.x
* Application that utilizes BlazeDS for communication. 
  * Want to see more libraries supported? Let me know in the issue tracker.
* JAR(s) containing all necessary remoting classes (VOs)

### Installation
-----------------------

1. Click Downloads and grab the latest JMeter-AMF package.

2. Copy jmeter-amf.jar to jmeter/lib/ext.

3. Download the version of BlazeDS that your application uses and copy blazeds-common.jar and blazeds-core.jar to jmeter/lib/ext.

3. Create a JAR containing any objects used in AMF Remoting, commonly referred to as VOs.
  * If a class is missing, it will probably not be included in the captured XML or delivered AMF.
  * A warning will be given _somewhere_.
  * Easy way: Select class files in Eclipse, Right-click -> Export, Select location and Finish

4. Either copy remoting JAR(s) to jmeter/lib/ext or add to the classpath with the Test Plan node.
