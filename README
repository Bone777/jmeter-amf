 JMeter AMF Plugin
---

Welcome to the JMeter-AMF Plugin Project. This plugin gives JMeter the ability to load test applications 
using the AMF3 protocol. Main features:

* Record AMF and HTTP traffic with the AMF Proxy Server
* Translate AMF to XML for easy manipulation
* Set override parameters to provide each virtual user with unique Client and Session IDs
